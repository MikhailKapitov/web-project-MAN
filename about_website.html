          <h2>About This Project</h2>
          <p>
            This project started as a way to explore web development and practice skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
            The main goal was to create a simple, adaptive, and modular website that could serve as a base for different types of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the development, special attention was paid to making the site responsive and visually appealing. <br>
            The design incorporates clean, minimalist principles with a focus on user experience. <br>
            JavaScript was used to dynamically load content into the page, making it fast and easy to develop, expand.

          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamic content loading via AJAX.</li>
            <li>Responsive design to ensure usability on all devices.</li>
            <li>Love and respect for Yaakov Chaikin. <3</li>
            <li>Clear and maintainable code structure to simplify future updates.</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns with distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that all components worked seamlessly together. 
            For example, dynamically loading snippets required careful handling of asynchronous-ish JavaScript and JSON data. <br>
            Additionally, creating a consistent design across multiple pages involved iterating on CSS styles and media queries.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these challenges, modular and reusable code structures were employed, along with thorough testing to ensure compatibility across browsers and devices.

          <h2>Mini Devlog!</h2>
          <p>
            For short technical notes, feel free to go through out git commits! Here, we will try to show the development visually, through a few snapshots.
          </p>
          <h3>
            At first, well, it was all text.<br>
            <img src="images/devlog/devlog-0.png">
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Then, some styles happened. Ooh!<br>
            <img src="images/devlog/devlog-1.png">
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Then, JS blog loader was added! Without any styles at first.<br>
            <img src="images/devlog/devlog-2.png">
          </h3>
          <h3>
            And the rest is history!
          </h3>
          <p>
            Again, it's not easy to show drastic JS and structural changes through website screenshots. But you hopefully see the things we went through by now. :)
